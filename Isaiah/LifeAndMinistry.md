# Isaiah: A Prophet of Vision and Courage

Isaiah, son of Amoz, wasn't just a prophet; he was a poet, a visionary, and a courageous voice challenging the injustices of his time.  Living in a tumultuous period in Judah's history (8th century BCE), Isaiah witnessed political intrigue, social unrest, and spiritual decline.  This context profoundly shaped his prophetic ministry, giving his words a weight and urgency that resonate even today.

His call narrative in Isaiah 6 depicts a powerful encounter with the divine, setting the stage for a lifetime of proclaiming God's word, even when it was unpopular or dangerous. This encounter transformed him, giving him the courage to speak truth to power.

What motivated Isaiah to persevere in his ministry despite facing opposition?  What can we learn from his unwavering commitment to speaking truth to power?
