## Quranic Interpretation (Tafsir)

### Context and Schools of Tafsir

**Tafsir** (Quranic exegesis) seeks to explain and interpret the meanings of the Quranic verses. Different schools and scholars have developed various interpretative methodologies over the centuries.

- **Classical Tafsir**: Early commentaries, such as those by **Ibn Kathir**, focus on the linguistic, historical, and theological aspects of the Quran.
- **Al-Tabari**: Considered one of the earliest and most comprehensive commentators, **Al-Tabari** combined linguistic analysis with historical context.
- **Mu'tazilah and Rationalist Tafsir**: This school emphasized reason and metaphorical interpretations, often engaging with philosophical concepts.
- **Esoteric Tafsir (Batin)**: Emphasized by certain Sufi orders and Shi'a traditions, this approach delves into the hidden and allegorical meanings of the Quran.
