## Naturalism and Realism in Art

### Breaking with Tradition

The art of the **Amarna Period** broke with the rigid, idealized forms of earlier Egyptian art, embracing **naturalism and realism**. This approach reflected Akhenaten’s philosophical pivot to depict the **reality of life** and **family bonds**.

- **Expressive Faces and Gestures**: Artworks from this period often depicted expressions of affection, concern, and human emotion, a significant departure from earlier representations.
- **Anatomical Realism**: The depiction of the human body became more lifelike, though at times exaggerated, such as Akhenaten’s elongated facial features and curvilinear forms.
