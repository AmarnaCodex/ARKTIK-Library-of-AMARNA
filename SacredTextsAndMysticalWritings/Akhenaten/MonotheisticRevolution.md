# The Monotheistic Revolution of Akhenaten

## Introduction

**Akhenaten** (r. 1353–1336 BCE), originally known as **Amenhotep IV**, initiated one of the most radical transformations in Ancient Egyptian religion by establishing the worship of **Aten**, the sun disk, as the supreme deity. This shift toward monotheism disrupted centuries of polytheistic tradition, leaving a lasting impact on religious thought and historical interpretation.
