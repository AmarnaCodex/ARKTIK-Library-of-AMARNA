# ARKTIK Library of AMARNA Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to the **ARKTIK Library of AMARNA**, a sacred digital sanctuary inspired by **Imhotep,** the first human architect, physician, and quantum physicist, whose legacy of visionary knowledge laid the foundation for the pursuit of wisdom, healing, and balance. **Akhenaten**, a student of Imhotep's teachings, championed enlightenment and spiritual awakening, shaping the path for **Moses,** who in turn influenced generations of seekers, including **Jesus**. Historical accounts reveal the flow of wisdom through **Saladin,** **Haile Selassie,** and many more. 

This is not the first attempt to create a crossroads of knowledge and spiritual harmony since the **burning of the Library of Alexandria**. The **golden age of Al-Andalus (Spain)** before the expulsion was a second great effort—a **New Atlantis**—where Christianity, Judaism, and Islam coexisted in peace and full exchange of wisdom. The **ARKTIK Library of AMARNA** represents a **Third Revival,** carrying forth this mission of unity, learning, and respect for all traditions. Our goal is to create a family-friendly environment where seekers of all ages can explore, learn, and engage in meaningful, transformative dialogue.

## Core Principles

1. **Inspiration from Imhotep and a Legacy of Enlightenment**  
   Rooted in the pioneering spirit of Imhotep and carried forward by Akhenaten, Moses, Jesus, Saladin, and Haile Selassie, the ARKTIK Library celebrates a lineage of spiritual and philosophical exploration that transcends boundaries. This is the **Third Revival** of a sacred exchange of knowledge.

2. **Respect and Reverence for All Traditions**  
   Every tradition represented within the ARKTIK Library of AMARNA—including, but not limited to, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Rasta, KMT (Ancient Egyptian spiritual tradition), Kabbalah, Natural Law, Quantum Mechanics, Zoroastrianism, and Ethiopian spiritual practices—must be treated with respect, reverence, and humility.

3. **Family-Friendly Environment**  
   All conversations and content must be suitable for audiences of all ages, fostering a respectful, safe space for children, families, and elders. **No exceptions** will be made for behavior or language that is not family-friendly, and violations will lead to immediate exile.

   All members are expected to approach discussions with a willingness to listen, learn, and engage thoughtfully. We recognize that every participant has a unique perspective and journey to share.

   This space must be free from harassment, hate speech, discrimination, and disrespect. We are dedicated to creating an inclusive environment where everyone can participate without fear of being marginalized or disrespected.
