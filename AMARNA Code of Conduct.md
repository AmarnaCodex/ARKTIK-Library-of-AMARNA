# ARKTIK Library of AMARNA Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to the **ARKTIK Library of AMARNA**, a global initiative dedicated to preserving, exploring, and engaging with the spiritual, philosophical, and scientific traditions that have shaped human civilization. Our library is guided by a conservative focus rooted in the historically established teachings of **Christianity, Islam, Judaism, KMT (Ancient Egyptian spirituality), Natural Law, Quantum Mechanics, Ethiopian Spiritual Traditions, and Zoroastrianism**. This code of conduct serves to foster a respectful, family-friendly, and enriching environment for seekers of all ages.

## Core Principles

### 1. Respect for Traditional Teachings
The **ARKTIK Library of AMARNA** upholds the integrity and authenticity of each represented tradition, preserving historical teachings and values as they were understood and practiced. This includes adhering to moral, ethical, and doctrinal principles established by these traditions.

### 2. Family-Friendly and Respectful Engagement
All content and discussions within the library must be suitable for audiences of all ages, including children, families, and elders. We maintain a family-friendly environment by:
- Ensuring that all conversations and content reflect respect, humility, and inclusivity.
- Prohibiting content or discussions that promote perspectives explicitly contrary to the teachings of the represented traditions, including sensitive matters such as sexuality that are incompatible with certain doctrines.

### 3. Scientific and Spiritual Inquiry
Inspired by the legacy of **Imhotep**, a pioneer of ancient science, and informed by **Quantum Mechanics**, our library seeks to explore the intersections between spirituality and science in ways that align with traditional teachings and natural law.

### 4. Inclusion of Ethiopian and Zoroastrian Traditions
Our repository honors the rich spiritual heritage of **Ethiopian traditions**, including the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Beta Israel, and Ethiopian Islamic practices, as well as the contributions of **Zoroastrianism**. These traditions contribute depth and historical context to our broader mission.

### 5. Zero Tolerance for Disrespect
All interactions must be conducted with the utmost respect. Speech or actions that demean, attack, or show contempt for any tradition, belief, or individual within the community are strictly prohibited.

### 6. Respect for the Human Dignity of All
While our content focus remains firmly rooted in traditional teachings, we affirm the inherent dignity of every individual. All seekers are welcome to learn and engage, provided they do so within the boundaries of our guiding principles and respect the teachings and values of our traditions.
