## Imhotep and the Neferti Prophecy

### Imhotep’s Legacy as a Just and Wise Leader

**Imhotep** embodied many of the qualities described in the Neferti Prophecy: wisdom, justice, and the ability to bring order and prosperity. As a **vizier**, he guided Pharaoh Djoser’s policies and oversaw monumental projects like the **Step Pyramid**, symbolizing stability and divine order.
